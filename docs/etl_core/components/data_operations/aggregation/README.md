## Aggregation Types

### Flexible Grouping Operations

The aggregation component supports **wide range of grouping scenarios** for different analytical needs. You can group data by **single fields** for basic analysis, or **combine multiple fields** to create sophisticated groupings. The component also supports **nested field grouping** using dotted notation, allowing you to work with complex data structures seamlessly.

### Comprehensive Aggregation Functions

The component provides a **rich set of built-in aggregation functions** covering the most common analytical needs. **Mathematical functions** like sum, mean, and standard deviation help understand data distribution and central tendencies. **Statistical functions** provide insights into data ranges and frequencies, while **custom functions** allow you to implement domain-specific calculations.

### Multi-Strategy Processing

One of the component's greatest strengths is its ability to **adapt to different data processing scenarios**. For **real-time analytics**, the row processing strategy provides immediate results as data streams in.
