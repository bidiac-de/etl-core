# Filter System Documentation

## Overview

The Filter System in ETL-Core provides a powerful and flexible way to filter data across different data processing strategies (row, bulk, and bigdata). It supports both simple column-based filtering and complex logical expressions using AND, OR, and NOT operators.

## Core Components

### FilterComponent
The main component that delegates filtering operations to the `FilterReceiver`. It supports three processing strategies:
- **Row-based**: Processes individual rows one at a time
- **Bulk**: Processes pandas DataFrames in chunks
- **BigData**: Processes Dask DataFrames for large-scale data

### ComparisonRule
Defines the structure for filter rules, supporting both leaf rules (simple comparisons) and logical nodes (complex expressions).

## Filter Rule Types

### 1. Leaf Rules (Simple Comparisons)

Leaf rules perform direct comparisons on specific columns:

```python
{
    "column": "age",
    "operator": ">=",
    "value": 18
}
```

**Supported Operators:**
- `==` - Equal to
- `!=` - Not equal to
- `>` - Greater than
- `<` - Less than
- `>=` - Greater than or equal to
- `<=` - Less than or equal to
- `contains` - String contains (for text columns)

### 2. Logical Node Rules (Complex Expressions)

#### AND Operator
Combines multiple rules with logical AND:

```python
{
    "logical_operator": "AND",
    "rules": [
        {"column": "age", "operator": ">=", "value": 18},
        {"column": "status", "operator": "==", "value": "active"}
    ]
}
```

#### OR Operator
Combines multiple rules with logical OR:

```python
{
    "logical_operator": "OR",
    "rules": [
        {"column": "department", "operator": "==", "value": "IT"},
        {"column": "department", "operator": "==", "value": "Engineering"}
    ]
}
```

#### NOT Operator
Negates a single rule:

```python
{
    "logical_operator": "NOT",
    "rules": [
        {"column": "status", "operator": "==", "value": "inactive"}
    ]
}
```

## Complex Nested Rules

The system supports unlimited nesting of logical operators:

```python
{
    "logical_operator": "AND",
    "rules": [
        {"column": "age", "operator": ">=", "value": 18},
        {
            "logical_operator": "OR",
            "rules": [
                {"column": "department", "operator": "==", "value": "IT"},
                {"column": "department", "operator": "==", "value": "Engineering"}
            ]
        },
        {
            "logical_operator": "NOT",
            "rules": [
                {"column": "status", "operator": "==", "value": "terminated"}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Data Type Support

### Numeric Columns
- All comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Automatic type conversion for compatible types
- Handles integers, floats, and mixed numeric types

### String Columns
- All comparison operators
- `contains` operator for substring matching
- Case-sensitive comparisons
- Handles empty strings and None values

### Boolean Columns
- `==` and `!=` operators
- Direct boolean value comparison
- Handles None values as False

### Date/Time Columns
- All comparison operators
- Automatic parsing of common date formats
- Handles timezone-aware and naive datetime objects

## Edge Cases and Special Behaviors

### 1. Missing Values (None/NaN)

**Behavior:**
- `None` values are treated as missing data
- NaN values in pandas are handled appropriately
- Missing values in comparisons generally result in False

**Examples:**
```python
# Rule: age > 18
# Row: {"age": None} -> Result: False (filtered out)

# Rule: status == "active"  
# Row: {"status": None} -> Result: False (filtered out)
```

### 2. Type Mismatches

**Automatic Type Conversion:**
- Numeric strings are converted to numbers when possible
- Date strings are parsed to datetime objects
- Boolean strings ("true"/"false") are converted to booleans

**Failed Conversions:**
- Invalid conversions result in False (row filtered out)
- No exceptions are thrown during filtering

**Examples:**
```python
# Rule: age > 18
# Row: {"age": "25"} -> Result: True (25 > 18)
# Row: {"age": "abc"} -> Result: False (conversion failed)

# Rule: created_date > "2023-01-01"
# Row: {"created_date": "2023-06-15"} -> Result: True
# Row: {"created_date": "invalid-date"} -> Result: False
```

### 3. Empty Collections

**Empty DataFrames:**
- Returns empty DataFrame (no rows to filter)
- No errors thrown

**Empty Lists in OR/AND:**
- AND with empty rules list: Always False
- OR with empty rules list: Always False
- NOT with empty rules list: Validation error

### 4. Column Not Found

**Behavior:**
- Missing columns result in False (row filtered out)
- No exceptions thrown
- Logs warning for debugging

**Example:**
```python
# Rule: salary > 50000
# Row: {"name": "John", "age": 30} -> Result: False (salary column missing)
```

### 5. Invalid Rule Combinations

**Validation Errors:**
- Rule cannot be both leaf and logical node
- NOT operator requires exactly one sub-rule
- AND/OR operators require at least one sub-rule
- Missing required fields for leaf rules

## Performance Considerations

### Row Strategy
- **Best for:** Small datasets, real-time processing
- **Memory usage:** Low (one row at a time)
- **Performance:** Good for simple rules, slower for complex nested rules

### Bulk Strategy
- **Best for:** Medium datasets, pandas operations
- **Memory usage:** Medium (chunked processing)
- **Performance:** Excellent for vectorized operations

### BigData Strategy
- **Best for:** Large datasets, distributed processing
- **Memory usage:** Low (lazy evaluation)
- **Performance:** Best for complex rules on large datasets

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Rule structure validation at component initialization
- Clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Prevents runtime errors during filtering

### Runtime Errors
- Graceful handling of data type mismatches
- No exceptions thrown during filtering operations
- Failed comparisons result in False (row filtered out)

### Logging
- Warning logs for missing columns
- Debug logs for type conversion failures
- Performance metrics for monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Simple Filter
```python
from etl_core.components.data_operations.filter.filter_component import FilterComponent
from etl_core.components.data_operations.filter.comparison_rule import ComparisonRule

# Create a simple filter
rule = ComparisonRule(
    column="age",
    operator=">=",
    value=18
)

filter_component = FilterComponent(rule=rule)
```

### Complex Filter
```python
# Create a complex nested filter
rule = ComparisonRule(
    logical_operator="AND",
    rules=[
        ComparisonRule(column="age", operator=">=", value=18),
        ComparisonRule(
            logical_operator="OR",
            rules=[
                ComparisonRule(column="department", operator="==", value="IT"),
                ComparisonRule(column="department", operator="==", value="Engineering")
            ]
        ),
        ComparisonRule(
            logical_operator="NOT",
            rules=[
                ComparisonRule(column="status", operator="==", value="terminated")
            ]
        )
    ]
)

filter_component = FilterComponent(rule=rule)
```

### Processing Data
```python
# Row processing
async for filtered_row in filter_component.process_row(row, metrics):
    # Process filtered row
    pass

# Bulk processing
async for filtered_df in filter_component.process_bulk(dataframe, metrics):
    # Process filtered DataFrame chunk
    pass

# BigData processing
async for filtered_ddf in filter_component.process_bigdata(dask_df, metrics):
    # Process filtered Dask DataFrame
    pass
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Rule Design
- Keep leaf rules simple and focused
- Use logical operators to combine simple rules
- Avoid deeply nested structures (>3 levels)
- Test rules with sample data before production

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Use bulk strategy for medium datasets
- Use bigdata strategy for large datasets
- Avoid complex rules in row strategy
- Consider rule complexity vs. data size

### 3. Error Prevention
- Validate data types before filtering
- Handle missing columns gracefully
- Test edge cases with sample data
- Monitor filtering performance metrics

### 4. Maintenance
- Document complex rule structures
- Use descriptive column names
- Regular performance monitoring
- Update rules based on data schema changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. All rows being filtered out:**
- Check column names match exactly
- Verify data types are compatible
- Test with simple rules first

**2. Unexpected filtering results:**
- Check for None/NaN values
- Verify operator logic
- Test individual rule components

**3. Performance issues:**
- Switch to appropriate strategy (bulk/bigdata)
- Simplify complex nested rules
- Monitor memory usage

**4. Validation errors:**
- Check rule structure syntax
- Ensure required fields are present
- Verify logical operator usage

### Debugging Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Test with basic leaf rules first
2. **Incremental Complexity:** Add logical operators one at a time
3. **Sample Data:** Use small datasets for testing
4. **Logging:** Enable debug logging for detailed information
5. **Metrics:** Monitor filtering performance metrics
