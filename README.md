# ETL Core Engine

The ETL Core Engine is a modular Python-based tool that interprets JSON configurations to execute ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows. Built on the **Command Pattern**, it allows for clear orchestration of ETL jobs with support for component-based execution, metrics tracking, and extensibility for various data backends and operations.

## Overview

The ETL Core Engine is responsible for interpreting a structured configuration (in JSON format) and executing the described job directly, without generating Python code.

Key features include:

- Command-based execution of ETL steps
- Support for various sources and sinks (CSV, SQL, etc.)
- Component-level metrics and structured job tracking
- Designed for integration with external UIs via JSON configuration
